# Basic text guessing game (Hangman) on the terminal written in C++

Simple personal take on the Cppman (Hangman) game that was given as a quiz task from learncpp.com site after array chapter. Gameplay is very simple as the user needs to guess the given word. If the player fails to guess the letter for 6 times, the game ends, otherwise it continues until the player guesses all the letters.
