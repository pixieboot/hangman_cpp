# Basic text guessing game (Hangman) on the terminal written in C++

Personal take on the simple Cpp-man (Hangman) game that was given as a quiz task from "learncpp.com" site during the topic of arrays, the quiz task can be found at the bottom of the page here[https://www.learncpp.com/cpp-tutorial/chapter-16-summary-and-quiz/].

## Gameplay and technical details

The player needs to guess the letters of a random picked word from the array of words. If the player fails to guess the word and doesn't manage to guess any letters for 6 times, the pluses (attempts) will fill up with the wrong given letters and the game will end, otherwise the game continues while the correct letters are revealed at the position where they belong in the word until the player guesses all the letters accordingly. At the end game state, the player can choose if they want to continue playing more or exit the program.
